# MathematicaEquationToPython
A python program to parse lists of Mathematica CForm equations and produce python functions

My work often involves the derivation of high order multicomponent protein/ligand/dna binding equations with multiple solutions.  Converting these equations, even using Mathematica's CForm conversion routines becomes combersome with large formulas of > 100s of lines.

This program allows the cut and paste of (optionally a list of) Mathematica CForm expressions into a text file, which is then processed by this python program and produces python functions for inclusion in other programs.

## Example usage
Worked example comming soon.
